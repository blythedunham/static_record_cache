StaticRecordCache
=================

This plugin has two options for caching records of Static classes which change rarely or never



==================================
StaticActiveRecordContext
==================================
Extends the active_record_context plugin,
http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/active_record_context/
to permanently cache records for an ActiveRecord subclass

Finds on records IDS (as used by associations)  will be cached for the life of the class.
This works both in and outside a  with_context block.

Example
=======

class TelephoneCarriers < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend StaticActiveRecordContext
end

phone_number.carrier

==================================
ActsAsStaticRecord
==================================
Permanently caches subclasses of ActiveRecord.
Finds on boths IDs and individual fields will be cache hits
A cache key :key option can be specified, and additional :find scope is permitted

Example
=======

Simple:

class TelephoneCarriers < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_static_record
end

Using options:

class TelephoneCarriers < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_static_record :key => :phone_number_digits,
                    :find => :select => 'carriers.*, phone_number.number as phone_number_digits'
                    :joins => 'inner join phone_numbers on phone_numbers.carrier_id = carriers.id'

  def phone_number_digits
    self['phone_number_digits']||self.phone_number.number
  end
end
